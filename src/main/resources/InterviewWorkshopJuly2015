Techniques
===========
Arrays: 
 1. more than one pass: take sum or cum sum on first pass
 2. practice 2d matrix...
 3. walk thru array once, use 2 pointer to look left and right
 4. for "symetric" patterns like balance point consider both even and odd array size
 
 Substrings:

Hi,

It was SO nice to have you all in our first programming interview workshop. As mentioned in my earlier email, I am hereby following up with 

1) Practice test

2)Information about the advanced workshop (part-2)

3) Supplementary material

Also feel free to ask for clarifications about any questions/algorithms at our Facebook page. I also post questions regularly to the page, so by liking the page, these questions will be a part of your Facebook feed.
Regards,
Jay

Practice Test : 

It is important to not let go the momentum you have gained. Here is a practice test on the topics we have covered so far.
 http://hr.gs/practicetest0702

I would love to discuss hints, suggestions and more with you. If you are stuck, please reach out for hints :)
 

Advanced Programming Workshop : 

The first workshop helped us gain momentum on interview preparation, and master a lot of programming 
interview related techniques on fundamental data structures. It is now time to learn more advanced topics that are frequently tested in programming interviews, but rarely used in professional software engineering.

The following are some of the topics the advanced workshop will focus on :
Recursion
Dynamic Programming
Graphs 
Tries
Design Questions

Some popularly asked questions on these topics : 

Given a string like BedBathBeyond and a dictionary, check if it is a concatenation by valid english words.

Given an array of Integers, find the longest increasing sub-sequence
{1,6,2,3,4, 2,5}.
The longest increasing sequence is 1,2,3,4,5.

Date:
We are planning to conduct our advanced programming workshop on July 11th. 

Cost:
As a token of appreciatio n for attending and making the previous workshop a success, the fee for the advanced workshop is discounted to 300$.

Supplementary material :

(I know the list is intimidating, but you don't need to have watched all of this to attend the workshop. Just skim through whatever you can)
