No. 01 - Binary Search Tree and Double-linked List 
Convert a binary search tree to a sorted double-linked list. We can only change the target of pointers, but cannot 
create any new nodes.

No. 04 - Paths with Specified Sum in Binary Tree 
All nodes along children pointers from root to leaf nodes form a path in a binary tree. Given a binary tree and a number, 
please print out all of paths where the sum of all nodes value is same as the given number. 
   f(int remaining, List<Int> parentPointerList)
   bc: if r==null and l==null and remaining==0 print pp list
   f(cur.left)
No. 06 - Post-order Traversal Sequences of Binary Search Trees 
Determine whether an input array is a post-order traversal sequence of a binary tree or not. If it is, return true; 
otherwise return false. Assume all numbers in an input array are unique.

No. 31 - Binary Search Tree Verification 
How to verify whether a binary tree is a binary search tree?

No. 45 - Closest Node in a Binary Search Tree 
Given a binary search tree and a value k, please find a node in the binary search tree whose value is 
closest to k. 

No. 46 - Nodes with Sum in a Binary Search Tree
Given a binary search tree, please check whether there are two nodes in it whose sum equals a given value.
