# lru cache

see png file

we need doubly linked so that each time we find a hit we move that Node to the front of the Linked List

 an LRU Cache requires that insert and delete operations should be in O(1) time.
  The obvious choice for this requirement is Linked List. Linked List support insert/delete operations
  in O(1) time if we have the reference of element.
